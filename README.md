Based on the provided Key Responsibilities and Technologies & Skills, here is a Python code framework that can align with the roles and technologies you've described. The framework is designed to work with data sources, machine learning models, cloud platforms, and tools like Databricks, AWS, Azure, SageMaker, and Athena.

This code includes key components for data exploration, data processing, model building, data pipelines, and collaborating with cross-functional teams by deploying machine learning models on cloud platforms.
Python Code Framework for the Given Responsibilities
1. Data Discovery and Exploration (Exploring New Data Sources)

Here’s a Python code snippet for connecting to a relational database using SQLAlchemy, querying data, and performing some initial data exploration.

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Establish connection to a SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
def connect_to_database(connection_string):
    engine = create_engine(connection_string)
    return engine

# Query data from the database
def query_data(engine, query):
    df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
    return df

# Example of discovery and initial exploration
connection_string = "postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase"
engine = connect_to_database(connection_string)
query = "SELECT * FROM customer_data LIMIT 10"
df = query_data(engine, query)

# Display the first few rows of the data
print(df.head())

2. Design and Execution (Building Data Models, Pipelines, and Workflows)

For Databricks and Azure, you can use Databricks SDK for Python and Azure SDK for Python to handle data pipelines and machine learning workflows. Here’s an example of using Databricks for large-scale data processing.

# Databricks Python API Example: Create a Databricks notebook for data pipeline
import databricks_api

# Instantiate the Databricks client
db = databricks_api.DatabricksAPI(token='YOUR_API_TOKEN')

# Example: Read from a Databricks Delta Table and process data
def read_delta_table(path):
    df = db.dbutils.fs.head(path)
    return df

# You can also implement jobs or schedules for automated tasks
def submit_databricks_job(job_name, job_config):
    response = db.jobs.create_job(job_config)
    return response

# Sample job submission for a data pipeline
job_config = {
    'name': 'ETL Job',
    'new_cluster': {
        'spark_version': '6.4.x-scala2.11',
        'node_type_id': 'r3.xlarge',
        'num_workers': 8
    },
    'notebook_task': {
        'notebook_path': '/Users/your-user/data_pipeline_notebook'
    }
}
response = submit_databricks_job('ETL Job', job_config)
print(response)

3. Data Hypothesis Testing and Experimentation (ML Models)

You can build machine learning models using scikit-learn, SageMaker, or AWS SageMaker for experimentation. Here's an example using scikit-learn to build and test a simple machine learning model (e.g., linear regression).

# Example for hypothesis testing and experimentation with scikit-learn
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# Load a sample dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
boston = load_boston()
X = boston.data
y = boston.target

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build a Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

4. Operation and Optimization (Managing Data Infrastructure)

For data infrastructure management, you'll likely use cloud tools. Below is an example of working with AWS S3 and Athena to query data.

# AWS Athena Integration Example
import boto3

# Connect to Athena and execute SQL queries on S3
def execute_athena_query(query, database, s3_output_location):
    client = boto3.client('athena')
    response = client.start_query_execution(
        QueryString=query,
        QueryExecutionContext={'Database': database},
        ResultConfiguration={'OutputLocation': s3_output_location}
    )
    return response

# Example: Running a query on Athena
query = "SELECT * FROM company_financials LIMIT 10"
database = "financial_db"
s3_output_location = "s3://my-query-results/"
response = execute_athena_query(query, database, s3_output_location)
print(response)

5. Recommendation Systems (Building and Optimizing Recommendation Engines)

Here’s an example using surprise (a Python library) to build a basic recommendation system for collaborative filtering.

# Example: Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System
from surprise import SVD, Reader, Dataset
from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split
from surprise import accuracy

# Sample Data (user-item ratings)
data = {
    'user': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C'],
    'item': ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4', 'item1', 'item3'],
    'rating': [5, 3, 4, 2, 4, 5]
}

# Load data into a DataFrame
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Use Surprise's Dataset class to load the data
reader = Reader(rating_scale=(1, 5))
data = Dataset.load_from_df(df[['user', 'item', 'rating']], reader)

# Train-test split
trainset, testset = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2)

# Build and train the model (SVD in this case)
model = SVD()
model.fit(trainset)

# Predict ratings for testset and evaluate
predictions = model.test(testset)
rmse = accuracy.rmse(predictions)
print(f"RMSE: {rmse}")

6. Generative AI (Fine-tuning GPT-3 or GPT-4)

For Generative AI, you can use the OpenAI API to generate text. Below is an example of interacting with OpenAI’s GPT models.

import openai

# Function to generate text using GPT-3 or GPT-4
def generate_text(prompt):
    openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # or use 'gpt-4'
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example of generating content based on a prompt
prompt = "Explain the impact of AI on the healthcare industry."
generated_text = generate_text(prompt)
print(generated_text)

Key Technologies and Libraries to Use:

    Databricks for large-scale data processing and analytics.
    Python (scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, etc.) for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
    SQL for database querying and relational data management.

    Azure SDK for handling data and AI services on Microsoft Azure.
    Recommendation Systems using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering (e.g., surprise library).
